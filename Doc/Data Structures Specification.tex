\section{Purpose}
This document specifies the core data structures that are used by the \shortProduct{} software implementation. It covers the entities \client{}~\ref{sec:structure:client} and 
\server{}~\ref{sec:structure:server}. Structures common to more than one entity are under~\ref{sec:structure:common} and they are referred under entity \common{}.

\section{Definitions, Nomenclature and Conventions}

\subsection{Portability}
The data structures and their fields are specified in a way that is independent from the programming language and the execution platform. For integer types, the width is specified 
to avoid platform-dependent implementations from diverging. String and composite types (maps, hashtables, etc) are SDK-dependent, but implementation should not rely on any uncommon 
and SDK-specific behavior (eg, string can correctly be interpreted as an STL or Java string, but no type requirement beyond that is intended).

\subsection{Attributes}
Data structures are marked with a set of attributes. A list of markers in all caps appears after the data structure. These attributes are:

\newcommand{\persistent}{\MakeUppercase{persistent}}
\newcommand{\ephemeral}{\MakeUppercase{ephemeral}}
\newcommand{\secure}{\MakeUppercase{secure}}
\newcommand{\unsecure}{\MakeUppercase{unsecure}}
\newcommand{\infrastructure}{\MakeUppercase{infrastructure}}
\newcommand{\unique}{\MakeUppercase{unique}}

\begin{description}
 \item[\persistent] The data structure persists process restarts. For the client, this translates to the structure stored in the application storage space. For the server, that it 
is stored in the database or the filesystem.
 \item[\ephemeral] The opposite of \persistent. The data structure remains only in memory.
 \item[\secure] The data structure is to be stored in secure storage. Such data structures cannot leak or be tampered with. For the client, it is stored preferably in an encrypted 
lightweight database, such as SQLCipher~\cite{sql_cipher}. For the server, it means stored in a database that is secured and its installation hardened. \secure{} normally implies 
\persistent, although it is in theory possible that \ephemeral{} structures are secured in memory.
 \item[\unsecure] The data structure is not stored in secure storage. Such data structures can leak or be tampered without loss of information or compromising operation. An example 
is UI settings.
 \item[\infrastructure] Infrastructure data structures are used to compose higher level structures. They do not appear independently, therefore the infrastructure attribute is 
expected to appear alone.
 \item[\unique] This data structure is expected to have only one instantiation in each process. {\em Attention: this does not mean that the structure is to be implemented as a 
singleton}. Treat this attribute as informative and only as informative. This specification may change at any time due to requirement changes.
\end{description}

\subsection{Comments}
After the specification of the data structure, a short explanation of its functionality and usage may follow. This explanation should be treated as informative and not as part of 
the specification.

\subsection{Naming}
A data structure $X$ for entity $Y$ is specified in a section named after $Y$. When referring to $X$ from another section, its name is $Y.X$. Field $Z$ within $X$ is referred to 
as $X.Z$ ($Y.X.Z$ from another entity section).

All type names are upper CamelCase. All field names are lower camelCase.

\subsubsection{Non-native Primitive Types}
There are some field types, for example RSA keys, that are non-native, but are used in the specification as native. We assume that such types come from a library and their 
specification is implied by the library's API. As long as their intended functionality is well understood, we do not specify them further. If some points need to be elaborated on, 
details are provided in the comments.

\subsubsection{Containers and Enums}
Containers, such as maps and lists, are denoted with their properties. For example, a FIFO queue is denoted as such, although the platform implementation may be something like 
$deque$ in STL. We denote the types of their parameters inside parentheses, separated by colons. Therefore, a map from type $A$ to type $B$ is denoted as $map(A:B)$.

Enumerations are denoted as $\{ A, B, \dots \}$ where $A, B, \dots$ are members of the enumeration. Enumeration members are written in upper CamelCase.

\subsubsection{Inheritance, Typedefs and Templates}
A data structure $B$ extending $A$ is denoted as

\begin{verbbox}
B extends A
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

When a structure $B$ is a typedef of $A$, it is denoted as

\begin{verbbox}
B = A
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

A template class $A$ with template parameters $B$ and $C$ is denoted as

\begin{verbbox}
A<B, C>
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

For programming languages that do not support template constructs, inheritance can be used to achieve the same effect.

\subsection{Database}

\subsection{Keys, Indexes, Primary and Foreign Keys}
We define where applicable what the primary key is for a structure, which fields are foreign keys, which are keys and which have indexes. If the structure has a field named $id$, 
this is implicitly the primary key. If a structure has a primary key that is not named $id$, we explicitly define it.

\subsubsection{State}
Some of the operations on server structures involve manipulating state. These operations must be performed in the database, not the 
server code, which is stateless. If the database does not have the appropriate mechanisms to execute them, in the manner of MySQL triggers (\cite{mysql_trigger}), then some 
creative solution, like a garbage collection process, must be implemented.

\subsection{Initial Values and Default Values}
Where applicable we define where the initial value for a field comes from and what the default value is when the source is allowed to not provide one.

\subsection{Time}
All time-related fields are specified as having type {\em time}. This should be interpreted as a UNIX timestamp or any equivalent structure that carries full timezone information. 
All timestamps are generated at the server, for consistency across the system. In case the server is distributed, all server-side processes (including the DB) must share a common 
clock.

\subsubsection{UserAgent}

\begin{verbbox}
UserAgent
{
  platform, string
  version, string
}
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

\begin{inparaitem}[ ]
 \item \infrastructure
\end{inparaitem}

\paragraph*{Comments}
This structure is a representation of the type of client. It is built at process startup.

\SpecialItem
\begin{description}
 \item[platform] The platform information given by the system. This usually contains OS, OS version, hardware information, etc.
 \item[version] The version of the user agent. The type may change to something more structured.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Id}

\begin{verbbox}
Id = 64-bit signed integer
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

\begin{inparaitem}[ ]
 \item \infrastructure
\end{inparaitem}

\paragraph*{Comments}
Type alias for id types. It is defined as a signed data type instead of unsigned due to the unsigned type not being supported by most languages and systems.

\subsubsection{Client}

\begin{verbbox}
Client extends UserAgent
{
  id, Id
}
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

\begin{inparaitem}[ ]
 \item \infrastructure
\end{inparaitem}

\paragraph*{Comments}
This structure extends a user agent with a unique id across a user. The $id$ field is not a primary key for the system, it is a primary key inside a User clients set
(see~\ref{sec:structure:server:user}).

\subsubsection{User}

\begin{verbbox}
User
{
  id, Id
}
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

\begin{inparaitem}[ ]
 \item \infrastructure
\end{inparaitem}

\paragraph*{Comments}
This is the base for any type of User. It is a simple wrapper around an id, which acts as the key of any subtype.

\subsubsection{ClientId}

\begin{verbbox}
ClientId
{
  user, Id
  client, Id
}
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

\begin{inparaitem}[ ]
 \item \infrastructure
\end{inparaitem}

\paragraph*{Comments}
Convenience data structure that pairs together a user and client id. It is used to identify a client in the entire system.

\subsubsection{TimeoutMap}

\begin{verbbox}

{
  timeout, 16-bit unsigned integer,
    initial value from configuration, default = 60 000 (1'')
  Map = map(T:time)
  entries, Map
  entriesList, FIFO queue(Map.iterator)
}
\end{verbbox}
\begin{center}
\theverbbox
\end{center}

\begin{inparaitem}[ ]
 \item \infrastructure
\end{inparaitem}

\paragraph*{Comments}
This is a structure whose implementation depends a lot on the data storage back-end. On RDBMSs it is straightforward to implement it, but NoSQL backends can only implement a 
simplified version of it, where the garbage-collection is done by the server. The following is specified with RDBMSs in mind. For NoSQL the specification is used to define the 
functionality of the garbage collector.

This structure is a map for expirable objects and for periodically garbage-collecting items that have expired. The garbage collection can be triggered periodically (the period 
should not be less than two times the timeout value) or when the map size has exceeded some threshold.

Note that entries are removed from the map only during garbage collection. If a lookup operation retrieves an expired entry, it is not removed from the map, because the 
corresponding iterator needs to be removed from the list. This can be implemented, but it would complicate the code and it would degrade performance, for minimal gain in memory 
consumption.

\SpecialItem
\begin{description}
 \item[timeout] The time in msecs for which an entry is considered active. If a platform offers a type for time difference, like C++11 does, this more appropriate type must be 
used for the field.
 \item[entries] It maps objects of type $T$ to a timestamp produced when an object is inserted into the map. If hash maps are available for the platform, they must be used instead 
of a map.
 \item[entriesList] This list is used to garbage-collect items efficiently. The entries point to items in the orders map. The FIFO nature of the queue ensures that garbage 
collection can start from the oldest entry and proceed until an unexpired entry is found. The cost of garbage collection is constant per entry. Please note that if a platform 
doesn't support iterators, the entry id can be used as the value type.

 \item \secure
 \item \persistent
\end{inparaitem}

\paragraph*{Comments}
The map removes pending identity registration information after they timeout without confirmation. The timeout is set to a year, so that the mappings are not removed prematurely. 
Since the map is not expected to grow large enough to create space problems, the map could be implemented as FIFO queue with a maximum size, as long as the size is large enough 
entries are not cleared prematurely.

\SpecialItem
\begin{description}
 \item[identity] The information about the identity whose registration is pending.
 \item[blind] The blind used to generate $identity$.

 \item \unique
 \item \secure
 \item \persistent

\paragraph*{Comments}
This value can be set only once during the lifetime of a client. If it is overwritten or lost after it has been set, the client needs to reset its state and start as if installed 
for the first time.
